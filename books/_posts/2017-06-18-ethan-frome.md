*Caution : Potential Spoilers ahead!*

When staying in Urbana-Champaign for the summer, what better idea than to look up potentially depressing reads on Reddit? That's how I came across Ethan Frome, by Edith Wharton. It would seem that opinion on the book is, well, highly divided. I found it to be an entertaining (in a hope-draining, soul-sucking way) read. The opening bit at a post office did bring back memories of 'The Letter' (CBSE sufferers, unite!), though I'm glad it didn't unfold in any way like Dhumketu forced me (us?) to endure.

There's enough metaphors to go around for everyone, and the ending turns out to be even more bitter than I'd hoped. 10/10 would allow it to drain my happiness away again.
